This is the official app that controls our project "GreenBot".

Our project consists of a fully autonomous robot, that given a drawn path, it can follow a realtime scaled version of that path on a piece
of land and collects fruits on his way that are about to get spoilt. Using an Image Processing algorithm and a fully Electric Robotic
arm with a load sensor it detects the non-damaged fruits by its color and the amount of force that is applied to it. The app connects to
the robot via Bluetooth then the path is drawn on a paintView and sent to the robot to start his cycle.
The robot is programmed to work with multiple types of fruits that the user selects in the app. And there is also a bunch of other
optional settings the user can choose, he can create a canvas with the ratio of the piece of land for better precision or add a background
image of the piece of land to the paintView if he's connected to an internet service, then the image is saved in internal storage for
later use even when offline.

The project currently is functional but it's still under development and improvements.
